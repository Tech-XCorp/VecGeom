This is the directory to define the backend traits.

Some things we discussed was the following

I think we wanted to have something like

using DefaultScalarBackend = Backend::Scalar::kScalar;
using DefaultVectorBackend = Backend::Vector::kVc;

Then we could use them as

DefaultVectorBackend<float>::Double_v

etc.

It is important to have both Scalar and Vector backends available since
there is often a distinction ( we might want to use both programming models ).

On NVCC they can default to the same thing:

using DefaultScalarBackend = Backend::Scalar::kCuda;
using DefaultVectorBackend = Backend::Vector::kCuda;
