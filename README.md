Installation
============

VecGeom uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) for configuration and GMake for building.

Quick start
-----------

Configure and build VecGeom using default parameters, installing into the build directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`
    make install

Requirements
------------

### Configuration
CMake >= 2.8.8.

### Compilation
A C++11 compatible compiler is required.
The library has been tested to compile with (but is not necessarily limited to):

- GCC >= 4.7.3
- Clang >= 3.4
- ICC >= 14.0.2

### Dependencies

#### Vc
If Vc is used as the backend for SIMD instructions, CMake must be able to find the package. The Vc library is an [open source project](http://code.compeng.uni-frankfurt.de/projects/vc/).

Tested to compile with Vc >= 0.7.3-3.

#### Cilk Plus
When using Intel's Cilk Plus for SIMD instructions, CMake must be configured to compile with ICC.

#### CUDA
For CUDA support, an nVIDIA GPU with [compute capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs) >= 2.0 must be available, and the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) must be installed.

Tested to compile with CUDA >= 5.5 on GTX series >= 500.

CMake options
-------------

    OPTION [Default]
      Description.

    BACKEND [Vc]
      Specifies the backend used to generate CPU instructions. Available backends are:
      - Vc
      - Cilk

    VC_ACCELERATION [ON]
      Utilize Vc to accelerate operations performed on three dimensional vectors with SIMD instructions.

    CUDA [OFF]
      Enable CUDA support.

    CUDA_ARCH [20]
      nVidia GPU architecture for which CUDA will be compiled. Will be passed directly to NVCC as -arch=<CUDA_ARCH>.

    BENCHMARK [OFF]
      Enables the benchmarking module. Will support a number of targets to benchmark against depending on which optional dependencies are activated. Flags that affect this are:
      - CUDA
      - ROOT
      - USolids

    ROOT [OFF]
      Look for a ROOT installation to include ROOT interfacing modules and enable ROOT as a benchmarking case.

    USOLIDS [OFF]
      Enable USolids as a benchmarking case. Setting this to ON requires the USOLIDS_DIR variable to be set to the install directory of USolids.

    USOLIDS_DIR [NONE]
      USolids install directory. Ignored unless USOLIDS is set to ON.

    USOLIDS_INCLUDE_DIR [NONE]
      Can be used to specify the exact directory in which to look for USolids header files.

    USOLIDS_LIB_DIR [NONE]
      Can be used to specify the exact directory in which to look for USolids library files.
